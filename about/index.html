            <!-- <p>With a decade of experience from competing at a local studio, engaging in his high school's dance team, and further developing his physical artistry in college, Matt Bishop is a stylistically versatile performer and choreographer that embodies entertainment and storytelling</p> -->

                <div id="aboutText">
                    <p><span>Matt Bishop</span> started dancing for fun at the age of 9 with Rhythm & Shoes Dance Studio in Tontitown Arkansas. He has since competed solos, duos, small groups, and large groups in hip-hop, tap, jazz, contemporary, and lyrical. Leading into his senior year of high school, he joined his local high school’s dance and drill team, the Silver Stars of HAR-BER High School.</p>

                    <p>After high school, he moved nine-hundred miles away to Colorado State University where he started his pursuit towards a Bachelor of Arts in Dance with a Journalism Minor concentrated on film and media production. During his time in college, he served as Vice President and Financial Officer for the CSU Hip-Hop Dance Club, and currently serves as President for the club. As President, he has the unique opportunity to use his passion for hip-hop to facilitate a positive, supportive, and inclusive environment for a club that seeks to bring the culture of hip-hop dance to the community.</p>
                    
                    <p>Going forward, Matt seeks to pursue his dance career through the means of performing, choreographing, teaching, and taking lighting design opportunities. Matt would like to acknowledge his Mom and all the sacrifices she’s made that have allowed him to dance, for he would not be where he is without her support. Matt also gives thanks to his teachers from Rhythm & Shoes Dance Studio and his professors in the CSU Dance Department.</p>

                <p id="lightingText">While pursuing dance, Matt grew an interest in lighting design as he took Lighting Design I & II from Professor Price Johnston. He has since been the lighting designer for CSU’s summer dance program, DanceLab, two years in a row. The second year of which he choreographed and did the lighting for his own work, <span>Call of the Blazing Stallion</span>. Additionally, he was lighting designer for an interdisciplinary film project, Baby Book, with Professor Madeline Harvey.</p>

                <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
                <p>My favorite thing about dance is that it’s an outlet for me to release my energy. I channel that energy in a creative manner by using my higher consciousness to spiritually engage with my artistic voice. This allows me to step far outside the bounds of what I’m comfortable with, thus enabling me to materialize ideas and movements that are the purest expression of who I am as an artist.</p>
                <p>As an artist, I love to explore fictional made-up concepts and themes. Either enhancing worlds that already exist, or by creating new worlds that are out of this world.</p>
